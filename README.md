# Jenkins Cookbook

## Introduction

### Local environement for CI/CD

In _Env_ directory is located docker-compose file with following services:

- **Jenkins** To run our pipelines and do a job done. [Official website](https://www.jenkins.io/)
- **Gitlab** GitLab to get some UI for Git itself and also GitLab Runner for pipelines directly within GitLab. [Official website](https://about.gitlab.com/)

> Why Jenkins and GitLab when they can be used in same way? Yes, GitLab is focused to be The Only DevOps platform. But I will always prefer Jenkins anyway :smile:. It is your choice to try both and find out which one fits best for your needs! This is a reason why we have them both.
